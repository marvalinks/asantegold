      <p class="mt-60 md:mt-30">Asante is a gold exploration, development and operating company with a high-quality portfolio of projects and mines in Ghana. <br>
      Asante is currently operating the Bibiani and Chirano Gold Mines and continues with detailed technical studies at its Kubi Gold Project for early production. <br>
      All mines and projects are located on the prolific Bibiani and Ashanti Gold Belts.  Asante is also exploring its Keyhole, Fahiakoba, and Betenase projects 
        for new discoveries, all adjoining or along strike of major gold mines near the centre of Ghanaâ€™s Golden Triangle. Asante has also made a strategic investment in Roscan Gold Corporation.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-30 md:mt-5">
        <h2 class="text-accent-1">Commencement</h2>
        First gold poured July,2022. Gold production ramp-up is progressing, to produce +250Koz/year from 2027 (with undergrond mining to commence 2025). <br>
        Process Plant capacity will increase from 3.0Mt/y to 4Mt/y by 2024.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-30 md:mt-5">
        <h2 class="text-accent-1">Development</h2>
        4 stage development of the Main Pit to support mining to +/- 350m depth and +8 years operations. This will access the approximate 2.3 Moz open pit resource. <br>
        Underground mine planning has advanced to add +/- 100Koz/y from 2025 and increase LOM to +12 years.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-30 md:mt-5">
        Exploration continues to develop satelite deposits and extend open pit mining beyond 10 years. <br>
        Tailings Dam is fully reconditioned and has +12 months storage capacity. A lift to provide additional 4 years storage capacity will start Q1 2024.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-30 md:mt-5">
        The Bibiani NI-43-101 Technical Report was issued mid July 2022. An update will follow at Q1 2024, to capture 2022/2023 exploration and mine planning results.
